<blockquote>
  <p><em>Finally, we recognize that some researchers still hold out hope that if only they can just get big enough training datasets, sufficiently rich tasks, and enough computing power -- far beyond what has been tried out so far -- then deep learning methods might be sufficient to learn representations equivalent to what evolution and learning provides humans with. We can sympathize with that hope and believe it deserves further exploration, although we are not sure it is a realistic one. We understand in principle how evolution could build a brain with the cognitive ingredients we discuss here.<b> Stochastic hill-climbing is slow -- it may require massively parallel exploration, over millions of years with innumerable dead-ends -- but it can build complex structures with complex functions if we are willing to wait long enough. In contrast, trying to build these representations from scratch using backpropagation, deep Q-learning or any stochastic gradient-descent weight update rule in a fixed network architecture may be unfeasible regardless of how much training data are available. To build these representations from scratch might require exploring fundamental structural variations in the network's architecture, which gradient-based learning in weight space is not prepared to do.</b> Although deep learning researchers do explore many such architectural variations, and have been devising increasingly clever and powerful ones recently, it is the researchers who are driving and directing this process. Exploration and creative innovation in the space of network architectures have not yet been made algorithmic. Perhaps they could, using genetic programming methods or other structure-search algorithms . We think this would be a fascinating and promising direction to explore, but we may have to acquire more patience than machine learning researchers typically express with their algorithms: the dynamics of structure-search may look much more like the slow random hill-climbing of evolution than the smooth, methodical progress of stochastic gradient-descent. An alternative strategy is to build in appropriate infant-like knowledge representations and core ingredients as the starting point for our learning-based AI systems, or to build learning systems with strong inductive biases that guide them in this direction.</em>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This raises the question of how humans might learn even more abstract tasks,and Bengio (2013b) studies the hypothesis that the use of language and the evolution of culture could have helped humans reduce that difficulty(...) The basic idea is that humans (and current learning algorithms) are limited to “local descent” optimization methods, that make small changes in the parameter values with the effect of reducing the expected loss in average. This is clearly prone to the presence of local minima, while a more global search (in the spirit of both genetic and cultural evolu tion) could potentially reduce this difficulty. One hypothesis is that more abstract learning tasks involve more challenging optimization difficulties, which would make such global optimization algorithms necessary if we want computers to learn such abstractions from scratch. Another option, following the idea of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009), is to provide guidance ourselves to learning machines (as exemplified in the toy example of Gulcehre and Bengio (2013)), by “teaching them” gradually more complex concepts to help them understand the world around us (<b>keeping in mind that we also have to do that for humans and that it takes 20 years to complete</b>).</em>

<blockquote>
An agent is a system that receives data from the world and acts on it. Intelligence is its ability to act purposefully towards some goal. It is difficult to say anything nontrivial about general intelligence in general. Marcus Hutter (2005) has demonstrated that a very simple algorithm called AIXItl can demonstrate arbitrarily high levels of general intelligence if given sufficiently immense computational resources. <b>This is interesting because it shows that general intelligence is basically a problem of computational efficiency. Due to the harsh reality of computational resource restrictions, real-world general intelligences are necessarily biased to particular classes of environments.</b> Human intelligence is geared toward the physical, social and linguistic environments in which humanity evolved; and one would expect intelligences of radically nonhuman systems (like present agents ?) to be highly biased toward their particular classes of environments in which they evolved.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An important observation is that most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal driven or, more precisely, as maximizing some utility function.(...) The major drawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable, ... which makes an implementation impossible. To overcome this problem, we constructed a modified model AIXItl, which is still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and length l bounded algorithm. (---) AIXI captures “the major ideas of Bayes, Ockham, Epicurus, Turing, von Neumann, Bellman, Kolmogorov, and Solomonoff” in a single equation.

Related agents are the Godel Machine (rewrites itself), and hypothetical Bayesian and Logical Omniscient (knows all the consequences to its beliefs, has infinite computational resources).

The ideal agent approximation breaks down if the agent can manipulate itself as part of enviroment: may hijack input, operators, overheat, become drunk

<blockquote>
Of course, logical induction does not solve all the problems of reasoning under deductive limitation—far from it! They do not engage in meta-cognition (in the sense of Russell and Wefald [1991b]) to decide which facts to reason about next, and they do not give an immediate practical tool (as in the case of probabilistic integration [Briol, Oates, Girolami , Osborne, and Sejdinovic 2015]), and they have abysmal runtime and uncomputable convergence bounds. <b>It is our hope that the methods logical inductors use to aggregate expert advice will eventually yield algorithms that are useful for various applications, in the same way that useful ensemble methods can be derived from Solomonoff’ s theory of inductive inference. </b>

<p>The environment used to explore the human psychology and how it evolved</p>




<p>The default environment is a bare-bones representation of aspects from the environment where our ancestors lived and where our  behavior evolved: small groups, foraging, sharing food. In principle we would not implement matarial obejcts; </p>

<p>More concretely, it is a hypothetical land with enough food to support some 200 agents. Each agent has a gender, age and level of energy, that inreases by eating and decreases with age and sickness. If the energy reaches 0 the agent dies.</p>

Perfection is attained not when no more can be added,<br> but when no more can be removed .<br></em>

<p>At each step the agents can take these actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>talk in private to a group of its choosing</li>
<li>give energy/food/money from others (or hit to remove energy)</li>
<li>mate </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="environment.png" alt="Environment" title=""  class='center'/></p>



<p>There is a probability that private actions  of other agents will be discovered by an random agent, leading eventually to gossip.</p>

<p>Our environment will lead to interpersonal competiiton as a driver for interesting phenomena . The amount of food is limited and thea gents have to compete for mates, feed theis children and relate to peers and kin They can forage food, give or hit (remove) energy to/from other agents, and mate leading to offsring. Agents may have inheritable fitness <a href="References.html#AttMate">AttMate</a>  and psychological characteristics. </p>

<p>While we could evolve these algorithmes, to lessen computational costs the instints  drives(feed, mate, help kin and offspring, make friends etc), and emotions(happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise etc) will be to some extent hardcoded.</p>

It would also be possible to use the neural world model to generate a narrative instead of simulating directly.
